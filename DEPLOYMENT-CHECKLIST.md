## üö® Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| RBAC assignment failures | Verify security group Object IDs |
| Naming conflicts | Update namePrefix in parameters |
| Deployment timeout | Check resource quotas and limits |
| Permission denied | Verify service principal permissions |
| Template validation errors | Run `./infra/pipeline/validate-all-bicep.sh` |

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Use rollback script
./infra/pipeline/rollback-deployment.sh

# Or manual cleanup
az deployment sub delete --name "failed-deployment-name"
az group delete --name "rg-gptdata-environment" --yes
```
