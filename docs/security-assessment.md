   - **Risk Level**: High
   - **Recommendation**: Implement Azure Sentinel or similar SIEM solution

3. API Security
   - **Gap**: No API schema validation
   - **Risk Level**: Medium
   - **Recommendation**: Implement strict schema validation in APIM policies

## Compensating Controls for Data Exfiltration Risk

Since data exfiltration policy cannot be enabled, implement these compensating controls:

1. Enhanced Monitoring
```json
{
    "monitoring": {
        "dataAccessPatterns": true,
        "volumeBasedAlerts": true,
        "anomalyDetection": true,
        "realTimeAlerts": true
    }
}
```

2. API Rate Limiting Policy
```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <rate-limit calls="100" renewal-period="60" />
        <quota calls="10000" renewal-period="3600" />
        <ip-filter action="allow">
            <address-range from="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" to="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" />
        </ip-filter>
    </inbound>
</policies>
```

3. Data Access Logging
```json
{
    "logging": {
        "level": "Verbose",
        "categories": [
            "DataAccess",
            "Authorization",
            "ApiCalls"
        ],
        "retention": "90days"
    }
}
```
